# Next.js Boilerplate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate template, which includes a pre-configured [Starlight SDK](https://react.sdk.starlight.sh/)
client, a functional layout with header and footer menus, mobile-first styles and a few pre-created pages that show
you how to request Starlight content using the SDK client.

This template is part of the [Web Templates](https://github.com/starlightcms/web-templates) repository, a collection of 
open-source starter templates for web applications created by the [Starlight](https://www.starlight.sh/) team.

## Using this template

The easiest way to bootstrap this template is by using the Starlight CLI:

```shell
npx @starlightcms/cli create nextjs --typescript
```

The CLI will clone this template locally and set-up the Starlight SDK for you.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
